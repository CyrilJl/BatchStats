.. Future Development

Future Plans
============

Here are some potential areas for future development of the ``BatchStats`` package:

- Adding additional statistics (``BatchOver``, ``BatchHist`` ?)
- Implementing ``xarray`` compatibility
- Improving memory consumption in ``BatchCov``
- Implementing shape checks
- Adding a ``dtype`` argument for better control of the underlying arrays

If you have any suggestions or would like to contribute to the development of BatchStats, please feel free to reach out to the maintainers or submit a pull request on the GitHub repository.
